# LearnRust
You will find in this repository differents little projects I created to learn rust. I will try to comment them a lot to guide you why I made such or such choice.

# Install Rust
At first, you need to install some tools for begin to create code with Rust.
 * [Install rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
 * Now you need to create a projet. Open CMD or terminal and type "cargo new \<name of your project\> --bin"
 
# Run projet
To run project git clone this repository and choose à project:\n
LearnRust repo\n
└ Project A\n

└ Project X\n
└ ...\n
 And inside the project example "repo/Project A/" open cmd or terminal and type "cargo run" to run the project. cargo run build and run the project. To open in release mode type "cargo run --release"\n
